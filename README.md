# Electronic Nose for Detecting Unpleasant Body Odor
## Overview
This project aims to develop an **"Electronic Nose"** capable of detecting unpleasant body odor, particularly the smell of sweat, in workplace environments. The device will identify poorly smelling individuals based on the detection of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with body odor and emit an audible alert when such odors are detected.

## Objectives
- Design and build a device that can recognize key chemical markers associated with human sweat and body odor.
- Utilize **gas sensors** or **electronic nose technology** to accurately identify unpleasant smells.
- Ensure real-time operation in workplace environments with minimal false positives.
- Develop a **sound alert system** to notify individuals about detected odors.
- Make the solution affordable, portable, and easy to use.
## Features
- **Odor Detection:** Senses VOCs commonly found in sweat, such as ammonia, fatty acids, and isovaleric acid.
- **Audible Alert:** Emits a sound to signal the detection of unpleasant body odor.
- **Configurable Sensitivity:** Allows customization of detection thresholds for different environments.
- **Compact Design:** Designed to be portable and suitable for workplace use.
## How It Works
1. **Sensing Odors:** The device uses an array of gas sensors (e.g., MOX sensors or other VOC detectors) to identify chemical compounds associated with sweat.
2. **Data Processing:** The sensor data is processed by a microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 or Arduino), which determines if the detected odor exceeds a predefined threshold.
3. **Alert Mechanism:** If the threshold is exceeded, the device triggers an audible alarm to alert individuals nearby.
## Potential Applications
- **Workplace Etiquette:** Encourages better personal hygiene by gently reminding individuals of potential issues.
- **Fitness Centers:** Monitors air quality and detects strong body odors.
- **Healthcare:** Assists in identifying medical conditions related to abnormal body odor.
## Technologies Used
- **Gas Sensors:** Detect VOCs in the environment.
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32, Arduino, or similar for sensor data processing.
- **Audible Alert System:** Speaker or buzzer for notifications.
- **Power Supply:** Battery-powered for portability.
## Project Goals
- Explore and implement **low-cost sensor solutions** for odor detection.
- Develop algorithms to process sensor data and reduce false positives.
- Build a **working prototype** and share design schematics, source code, and build instructions.
- Foster collaboration and open innovation in electronic nose technology.
